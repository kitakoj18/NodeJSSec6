<!-- ejs does not support layouts for base layout to extend in other ejs files like we can with pug/handlebars -->

<!-- <%= places a value in the script, but does not render it as html code e.g. if put string w html code, it will display the actual
characters of this string instead of rendering the html; use <%- instead -->
<!-- below imports layout from head.ejs in includes folder -->
<%- include('includes/head.ejs') %>
